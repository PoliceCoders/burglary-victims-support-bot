# Burglary Victims' Support Bot

A conversational tool to help the victims of burglary.

This is an open source project, led by volunteers.

[Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org) is a group for technical volunteers who'd like to spend their spare time and effort on something worthwhile, like helping the victims of crime.

If you're already sold and you'd like to contribute, read our [technical contributors' notes](CONTRIBUTE.md).

## Why tackle burglary?

[Burglary affects 2 in every 100 households](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/overviewofburglaryandotherhouseholdtheft/englandandwales), and it sucks! It's a miserable and frightening experience for the victim, and a huge drain on police resources.

* In 2017* there were [664,000 burglaries across the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2017#overview-of-crime).
* It's reported that [95% of burglaries in the UK are not solved](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/17/figures-less-than-5-of-burglaries-and-robberies-in-uk-solved).

_* the period from Oct 2016 to Sep 2017_

Police simply don't have the resources to reach every burgled home, or to investigate every crime. Victims of burglary might wait a few hours for a response, or a few days - if it is possible to send someone at all.

If a police officer can be spared, they'll be dispatched to the victim's home. Together with the victim, they'll complete these 5 steps:

1. Enumerate the losses, find old serial numbers, estimate the value of everything that was taken or broken. _Vital in case stolen property is found or returned._
2. Identify forensic opportunities. _CCTV, fingerprints, shoe prints, blood, etc._
3. Write a victim's statement. _Evidentially valuable should a suspect be arrested._
4. Examine the home together, offer prevention advice. _Important for the victim to feel safe, and to make it more difficult to burgle them again._
5. (Possibly) look at insurance on credit cards, etc. _Not everybody knows what insurance cover they have, and some people need more help than others._

Amongst all of this, the police officer knows that for each victim, this is a traumatic event. They are trained to offer comfort and reassurance, taking things at the pace of the victim and explaining every step of the process for them.

All of this takes time. The data collection component alone could take an hour or more (and increase that estimate if you live in a county where the officer must return to their police station to complete the report).

Afterwards, if there are forensic opportunities, a scene of crime officer or detective may be sent to continue the investigation...

## Our solution

We are building a conversational tool to help the victims of burglary make a start on their own investigation. From the word go, they'll be able to communicate with a friendly bot, through any medium they choose (Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, etc.) and get to work on the 5 steps.

We think it's comforting to know that progress is being made on the investigation, rather than sitting at home and waiting for the police. Transferring a little autonomy and control back to the victim gives them a little more dignity.

By deploying our bot, we think we could help to shave an hour off each burglary report (where it is used). This is a finger-in-the-air estimate, of course! Actual figures would come from a trial once the bot is ready.

At 100% uptake, that's 664,000 hours the police could get back and use to investigate those (or other) crimes. They could get to other emergencies quicker, and increase their presence when and where it's most needed.

### Yes, but...

_We know - it's not for everyone._

There are many reasons why a person might choose not to work with a bot. Some people are unable to use certain technologies, some don't trust them, some are vulnerable, confused or too distressed to do it. Some people are simply not ready to work with a digital assistant for reasons we've not thought of. That's okay.

If our tool only helped with half of the work, that's about 300,000 hours police officers could spend with the victims that need their time the most.
